# ML-IR
Simulation data and code of ML protocl for IR spectra of proteins (This project was supported by Prof. Shaul Mukamel(the University of California, Irvine), Prof. Jonathan D. Hirst(University of Nottingham),and Prof.Jun Jiang(University of Science and Technology of China).

The simulation data is about 6.1G was upload to: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3JGXMuR6y1UfEevV0oeiX4QAcPsovnS/view?usp=sharing.
